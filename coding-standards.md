# Coding Standard for Snake Game

## 1. Naming Conventions

### 1.1 Variables
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables.
- Follow the snake_case convention for variable names (e.g., `snake_block`, `score_font`).

### 1.2 Functions
- Use verbs or verb phrases for function names that describe their action (e.g., `our_snake`, `display_tips`).

### 1.3 Constants
- Use uppercase letters and underscores for constants (e.g., `WIDTH`, `SNAKE_SPEED`).

## 2. Code Structure

### 2.1 Indentation
- Use 4 spaces for each level of indentation.

### 2.2 Comments
- Include comments to explain complex sections of code or provide additional context.
- Follow a clear and consistent commenting style.

### 2.3 Function Structure
- Include a docstring for each function, describing its purpose, parameters, and return values.

## 3. Code Organization

### 3.1 Imports
- Import libraries at the beginning of the file.
- Group standard library imports, third-party imports, and local imports separately.

### 3.2 Main Loop
- Keep the main game loop (`game_loop()`) organized and easy to follow.

## 4. Formatting

### 4.1 Line Length
- Limit lines to a maximum of 80 characters.

### 4.2 Blank Lines
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code for improved readability.

## 5. Best Practices

### 5.1 Avoid Magic Numbers
- Replace magic numbers with named constants for better code understanding.

### 5.2 Error Handling
- Include appropriate error handling mechanisms where necessary.

## 6. Documentation

### 6.1 README.md
- Maintain an up-to-date `README.md` file providing information on how to run the game, gameplay instructions, and any additional details.

### 6.2 Comments in Code
- Use comments to explain complex algorithms, decisions, or any non-trivial code.

## 7. Miscellaneous

### 7.1 PEP 8 Compliance
- Strive to adhere to the [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

### 7.2 Version Control
- Commit small, logical changes to version control.

## 8. Authorship

### 8.1 Attribution
- Include authorship information in the file header.
